# Configuration

I don't know.

## Requirements

- Arch Linux (systemd)

  - A configured user.

- Rust

- paru

## How it works

[confls](./confls) resolves different [environments](./environments) listed,
and setup their dependencies, files and other configurations as needed, these environment must follow the [environment specification](./confls/specs/environment.md).
